### Introduction

Throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU I have been tasked with creating projects while developing my skills in various areas.  CS 499 : Computer Science Capstone challenged me to take the skills I have learned along with artifacts I have created and improve upon them in three categories: data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases.  This page and the works showcased display that I have successfully completed the challenges from this program and this class.

Below you will find links to the Professional Assessment, Code Review, Algorithm and Data Structures, Databases and Software Design and Engineering assigments. In each of those links their will be a further description of what was involved in my enhancements. It will also have links to the orginal and modified works.
