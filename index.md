## Introduction

Throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU I have been tasked with creating projects while developing my skills in various areas.  CS 499 : Computer Science Capstone challenged me to take the skills I have learned along with artifacts I have created and improve upon them in three categories: data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases.  This page and the works showcased display that I have successfully completed the challenges from this program and this class.

Below you will find links to the Professional Assessment, Code Review, Algorithm and Data Structures, Databases, and Software Design and Engineering categories. 
In each of those links you will find a further description of what was involved in my original work along with the enhancements.
Lastly, each category will have links the my original work and the enhanced version.
