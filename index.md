## CS 499 Portfolio


## Introduction

Throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU I have been tasked with creating projects while developing my skills in various areas.  CS 499 : Computer Science Capstone challenged me to take the skills I have learned along with artifacts I have created and improve upon them in three categories: data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases.  This page and the works showcased show that I have successfully completed the challenges from this program and this class.
