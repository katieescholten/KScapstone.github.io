## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

	
This artifact was part of the final project from the course CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance.  To meet the customer requirement for this project I had to deliver contact, task, and appointment services, the purpose of these services was to add, update, and delete task, contact, and appointment objects within the application. I chose to use specifically the Task Service project from the module four milestone which includes a Task and TaskService file along with Junit tests for each.  This project was created in February of 2021.


I selected this artifact to showcase my understanding of Java and Python languages. Transferring the artifact from one language to a different language shows that I can write in and read a project in Java *showcased here* and then write the same project in the Python language.  I met the course objectives that I planned to meet with the enhancement in module one by successfully transferring the project from Java to Python.


Throughout the computer science program, I have learned a lot, while creating this artifact I learned more about the Java language overall. I learned how to make my code technically sound by using techniques to maintain reusability of code.  Transferring the project to Python was challenging as I had to remember how Java worked as I have not used it in a while.  In my last class I used the Python language, so it was less challenging to write in that language.

## Algorithm and Data Structure Enhancement

For the category of algorithms and data structures for my artifact I chose to use the final project from the class IT 145: Foundation in Application Development.  To meet requirements for this project I had to create a monitoring system for zookeepers to keep track of the animal, their habitats, and if there are any problems with their habitat, food, or temperature or exit the system.  After selecting, subsections of what category you selected would display, including what type of animal or habitat you want to monitor.  A dialog would appear to alert the zookeeper if the monitor detected something out of normal range. Lastly, the system would allow the user to return to the original options to start over again if wanted. This artifact was created in August of 2019.


I chose to use this artifact for my ePortfolio because it was created over two years ago.  Since then, I have learned a lot in the classes I have taken and it shows the ability I have to go back to previous work, understand it, and enhance by adding additional content.  This artifact also shows my understanding of the Java language. The specific components that display my skills and abilities in data structure are the creating of the zookeeper.txt files that and the section in case 3 that displays the information.  Skills and abilities for algorithms are shown from adding case 3 with a selector for each input while also performing the actions of opening the files and displaying them after the input is selected.


I have met the course objectives for the enhancement of algorithm and data structure by adding in a new type of monitoring system to the project that provides more information to the zookeepers and adding complexity to the artifact.
Throughout this computer science program, I have gained quite few skills. While creating this artifact originally in 2019, I learned more about the Java language overall. One thing I learned was that two years ago, I did not follow best coding practices as I did not comment properly on the code to explain what I did.  It made me realize how important commenting is in code, because if I had, it would’ve been easier to go back to a project from two years ago and understand it easier.

## Databases Enhancement


The artifact for the databases category is from the final project in CS 340 Client/Server Development.  The purpose of this project was to act as a software developer for a company Grazioso Salvare which was looking for help to identify animals from a CSV file from Austin Animal Shelter for their rescue animal training program.  I developed a database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB.  I created a fully functional MongoDB dashboard to enable to the client to interact with and visualize the database.  This artifact was created in August 2021.


I selected this artifact because when I took the class a lot of the concepts were brand new to me. It introduced me to non-relational or NoSql databases.  I chose to enhance this artifact in the way I did because I find it much easier to work with SQL databases as opposed to Mongo No-Sql databases. The components where I had to change the code from using the MongoDB package to using SQLAlchemy shows my skills and ability to convert those calls from one data structure to another as well as one package to another. The artifact was improved because it is easier to manage, update and visualize the data in postgres. 


In module one I wasn’t sure about what enhancement to make in the Database category.  Since CS 340 was a recent class, I decided to use it since the material was relatively fresh to me.
The first challenge I faced was deciding on which database package to use. I was torn between using Psycopg or SQLAlchemy. I decided on SQLAlchemy because (from what I read) it can be used to interact with Mongodb or postgres databases. I found this to be a great advantage since then the code would pretty much stay the same no matter what database we switched to. 
I had to change the data structures for some of the arguments for them to work with SQLAlchemy. Since the data was easy for me to visualize in the Postgres database this turned out to be a mild obstacle to overcome.
