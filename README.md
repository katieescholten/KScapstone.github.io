## Introduction

I started the Computer Science program at SNHU in 2018.   This page contains work I have done throughout the Computer Science program and enhancements I recently made to showcase the skills I have learned.

## Professional self-assessment




















## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

	This artifact was part of the final project from the course CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance.  To meet the customer requirement for this project I had to deliver contact, task, and appointment services, the purpose of these services was to add, update, and delete task, contact, and appointment objects within the application. I chose to use specifically the Task Service project from the module four milestone which includes a Task and TaskService file along with Junit tests for each.  This project was created in February of 2021.
	I selected this artifact to showcase my understanding of Java *showcased here* and Python languages. Transferring the artifact from one language to a different language shows that I can write in and read a project in Java *showcased here* and then write the same project in the Python language "showcased here".
	I met the course objectives that I planned to meet with the enhancement in module one by successfully transferring the project from Java to Python.
Throughout the computer science program, I have learned a lot, while creating this artifact I learned more about the Java language overall. I learned how to make my code technically sound by using techniques to maintain reusability of code.  Transferring the project to Python was challenging as I had to remember how Java worked as I have not used it in a while.  In my last class I used the Python language, so it was less challenging write in that language.
