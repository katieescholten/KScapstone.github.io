## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

	
This artifact was part of the final project from the course CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance.  To meet the customer requirement for this project I had to deliver contact, task, and appointment services, the purpose of these services was to add, update, and delete task, contact, and appointment objects within the application. I chose to use specifically the Task Service project from the module four milestone which includes a Task and TaskService file along with Junit tests for each.  This project was created in February of 2021.


I selected this artifact to showcase my understanding of Java and Python languages. Transferring the artifact from one language to a different language shows that I can write in and read a project in Java and then write the same project in the Python language. I met the course objectives that I planned to meet with the enhancement in module one by successfully transferring the project from Java to Python. Specifically, mirroring the functionality of the Collections.binarySearch() method in Java to Python was a little difficult. I had to make a custom function that imported bisect_left method from the bisect module in Python.  Most of the code was much easier to write, read, and understand once I transcribed it over to Python. This is because you do not have to write types for variables or use curly brackets in Python. The formatting itself, by use of tabs specifies how the code is to be interpreted and executed. The Python code takes way less lines of code to perform the same functionality. 

Please see the table below for the numbers:

In every file there are less lines of Python then Java.


Throughout the computer science program, I have learned a lot, while creating this artifact I learned more about the Java language overall. I learned how to make my code technically sound by using techniques to maintain reusability of code.  Transferring the project to Python was challenging as I had to remember how Java worked as I have not used it in a while.  In my last class I used the Python language, so it was less challenging to write in that language.
