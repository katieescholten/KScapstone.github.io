## Databases Enhancement
---


The artifact for the databases category is from the final project in CS 340 Client/Server Development.  The purpose of this project was to act as a software developer for a company Grazioso Salvare which was looking for help to identify animals from a CSV file from Austin Animal Shelter for their rescue animal training program.  I developed a database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB.  I created a fully functional MongoDB dashboard to enable to the client to interact with and visualize the database.  This artifact was created in August 2021.


I selected this artifact because when I took the class a lot of the concepts were brand new to me. It introduced me to non-relational or NoSql databases.  I chose to enhance this artifact in the way I did because I find it much easier to work with SQL databases as opposed to Mongo No-Sql databases. The components where I had to change the code from using the MongoDB package to using SQLAlchemy shows my skills and ability to convert those calls from one data structure to another as well as one package to another. The artifact was improved because it is easier to manage, update and visualize the data in postgres. 


In module one I wasnâ€™t sure about what enhancement to make in the Database category.  Since CS 340 was a recent class, I decided to use it since the material was relatively fresh to me.

 
The first challenge I faced was deciding on which database package to use. I was torn between using Psycopg or SQLAlchemy. I decided on SQLAlchemy because (from what I read) it can be used to interact with Mongodb or postgres databases. I found this to be a great advantage since then the code would pretty much stay the same no matter what database we switched to. 
I had to change the data structures for some of the arguments for them to work with SQLAlchemy. Since the data was easy for me to visualize in the Postgres database this turned out to be a mild obstacle to overcome.
